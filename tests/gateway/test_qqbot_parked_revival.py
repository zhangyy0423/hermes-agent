"""F-T31 A4 — QQBot adapter parks (typed state + revival probe) instead of terminal silence.

Observed 2026-09-02 §3/§6-1: after ``Max reconnect attempts reached``, the
adapter performed zero reconnect action in-process for 6h39m with no typed
alert; only a new process revived it. The A4 apply borrows the MCP parking
pattern: the ladder topping out flips the adapter to ``parked`` (typed,
observable), emits a typed ``PLATFORM_ADAPTER_PARKED`` event line, and keeps a
bounded slow revival probe.

Zero-network criteria (from the A4 apply spec): mock DNS failure until the
ladder tops out and assert (a) state is parked, (b) a callable revive entry
exists, (c) a typed alert event was emitted. No real connection to
bots.qq.com is made.
