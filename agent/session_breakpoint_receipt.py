"""F-T31 A6 — typed session breakpoint receipts for network-class CLI turn failures.

Observed 2026-09-02 §4: five CLI sessions hit the local DNS outage
(``[Errno 8] nodename nor servname ...`` mid-turn) and their transcripts
simply STOP — no marker, no receipt, nothing that tells the returning human
where the conversation suspended. Recovery in every observed case was the
USER re-prompting 2.8 hours later; the session layer had zero automatic
continuation and zero receipt.

The A6 apply is deliberately minimal (the spec asks for a receipt, NOT for
auto-continuation): after a CLI turn fails with a network-class error, append
a typed assistant-side marker to the in-memory conversation history so it
persists with the session on terminal close. The marker names the suspension
class, the error summary, and the last successful user-turn index, so
``/history`` shows exactly where the break happened.

Classification reuses ``agent.error_classifier``: ``timeout`` reason covers
DNS/connect/transport per ``_CONNECTION_MESSAGE_PATTERNS``; ``server_error``
and ``overloaded`` are 5xx (upstream) and stay OUT of the network-receipt
class (a 5xx is not evidence the LOCAL session is suspended).
